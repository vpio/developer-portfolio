This project was very hands on for me. I consistently worked on all aspects of the application.

**Ruby on Rails** was at the core, using the **Active Record** ORM to query the database. Although most of the front end was also built using Ruby on Rails, we did use React.js for the parts we wanted to make more interactive (ie. Modals and Maps)

### Into The Code

One of the most challenging problems I ran into was this:

I needed to implement a **Notifications** feature for our application so that when one user offered to help another user move, that user would be notified of the other's offer.

This is how I implemented the feature:

1. I had to create a new Rails model to accommodate this feature. I called it _**Notification**_.
2. After I had figured that out, I needed to understand the model's relationship to the existing models. In this case, it would end up being that a Notification **`belongs_to`** a User and a User **`has_many`** notifications, and a Notification **`belongs_to`** a Proposal and a Proposal _**`has_one`**_ Notification.
3. Now that I had set up the model relationships, I needed figure out how and when a notification would get created. To do this I had to learn about Rails _Active Record Callbacks_. Using the _Active Record Callback_ **`after_create`**, I was able to call a function to create a new notification whenever a new proposal was saved to the database.

```rb
class Proposal < ApplicationRecord

  after_create :create_notification


  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :listing
  has_one :notification, dependent: :destroy


  def create_notification
    notification = Notification.new(message:"#{Proposal.last.user.first_name} wants to help you move!")
    notification.proposal = Proposal.last
    notification.user = Proposal.last.listing.user
    notification.save!
  end
end
```
