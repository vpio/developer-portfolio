## What is it?

* Two simple, text-based, minigames built with Vanilla JS.
* In order to get a better understanding of scope, closure, and modules in JS, I decided to build this application that modularized a number of different functions. This project required me to think really critically about where and how I declared my variables. That being said, if any programmers reading this are interested, I would love to get feedback on my code for this particular project! Click the link below to view the GitHub repo.
