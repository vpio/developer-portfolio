## React Hooks

I'm currently working as a Teaching Assistant at Wyncode Academy, the same bootcamp I learned to program at.

After talking to some of the recent graduates I learned that students are now being taught to use React Hooks, which supposedly makes developing with React a lot easier. It provides a new way to handle state, and it makes it so you don't have to use JS classes in your application at all!

Although I write code in React practically every day, I felt like I was behind the times! I decided to look into Hooks myself and so far have found them incredibly easy to use.

I can see myself moving into a completely functional style of programming using React Hooks, and I'd really like to get more familiar with how they work.
