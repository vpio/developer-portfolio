## What is it?

This application's value lies in the *WAY* a color palette is created - _Randomly_.

You open the application to a white background with a button that says "Change" in the center. Each press returns a randomly generated hex code that is applied to the background of the application. Once you've found a color you like - Save it so you can use it in your next project.

### About React Native

React Native has been surprisingly easy to transition to coming from React. Some of the differences that stick out to me so far include semantic differences - using `<View>` instead of `<div>` - and styling differences - using styling objects that are passed to components as props.

If you'd like to check out the code for the _Full Project_ go [here](https://github.com/vpio/React-Native-Color-Picker) to see the GitHub repository.

### AsyncStorage

One of the things I found really interesting about React Native was a built in storage system called AsyncStorage.

Using AsyncStorage, I was able to implement the ability to save data locally, without having to connect to a database.
