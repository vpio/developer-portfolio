excerpt: This past weekend I participated in the NBC/Universal Hackathon at the new Telemundo center in Miami, FL. My group built a social media platform for fan conventions with a gamification component so that users can win prizes and rewards. This project was built using React.js and Mongo DB.

## The 36 Hour React.js Marathon

For this project, I took on a Front End position - working mostly with *React*

These are the components I contributed to on this project:

* All components in the "HomeDashboard" directory
* All "Franchise" components in the "Franchise" directory

### Into The Code

One of the most challenging problems I ran into was this:

In the challenges component, I wanted to be able to send just _**ONE**_ request to the database but populate _**TWO**_ separate grids.

Here is how I solved it:
1. I made a single request on the _componentDidMount_ lifecycle method and stored the return value in a variable called _challenges_.
2. I used the .slice() method to store a sample of the original data set in a variable called _challenges1_
3. I used a function that rearranges the elements in an array via _Math.Random_. The function takes an array as an argument and returns nil. It modifies the original array.
4. Once the original array is shuffled, I use .slice() again and store this new sample of the original data set in a variable called _challenges2_.

    ```js
		async componentDidMount(){
			const id = "**************"
			let challenges = await challengesForRoom(id)
			let challenges1 = challenges.slice(0, 3)
			shuffleArray(challenges)
			let challenges2 = challenges.slice(0, 3)
			this.setState({challenges1: challenges1, challenges2: challenges2})
		}
    ```
5. Finally, I update the state with these values, and pass them down to my functional component via props.

I had a great time at the NBC Universal Hackathon! I've learned that Hackathons are a great way to learn a lot in a short amount of time. It's also a great opportunity to work in groups and get a better feel for your strengths and weaknesses.
