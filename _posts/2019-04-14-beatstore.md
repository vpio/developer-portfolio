## What is it?

* A simple E-commerce application that lets users browse and purchase hip-hop instrumentals made by various beat-makers.
* This application utilizes a combination of React.js, Tone.js, and a number of Google Cloud features such as Firebase and [GCS](https://cloud.google.com/storage/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=na-US-all-en-dr-bkws-all-all-trial-e-dr-1006141&utm_content=text-ad-none-any-DEV_c-CRE_79747411447-ADGP_Hybrid+%7C+AW+SEM+%7C+BKWS+%7C+US+%7C+en+%7C+EXA+~+Google+Cloud+Storage-KWID_43700034709668793-kwd-11642151515&utm_term=KW_google%20cloud%20storage-ST_google+cloud+storage&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtMvlBRDmARIsAEoQ8zSggL0b0GFmDk_oQ5vug2v6ToWWadlTAFfDkNmPn23rB13FFhel-goaAv-lEALw_wcB).

### Small Bytes (pun intended)

This application definitely turned out to be the most ambitious project yet in my #30AppChallenge. My intention was to build a fully functional e-commerce application and I ended up completing a semi-functional music player with an e-commerce UI.

In order to make this application fully functional, there is so much more I need to learn about Google Cloud Services. Not to mention I didn't even begin to try to implement any kind of payment functionality.

The #30AppChallenge has already taught me how easy it is to underestimate the size of a project. Moving forward, I'll do my best to assure that I take on projects in 'byte' size, manageable tasks.
