## Firebase

I took on these tutorials to learn Firebase because i've been wanting to gain familiarity with a backend framework that utilizes a non-relational database. I had heard a lot of great things about the platform and its simplicity, and I wanted to learn something fast so I could build a Full Stack application for my 30 app challenge (without using Ruby on Rails).

I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to use Firebase. With Firebase, Google even took the time to eliminate some of the most trivial headaches. For example, rather than formatting a `fetch` request or installing a package to handle requests, the api has a built in function called `get()` that points to the database url contained in the `config` object thats passed when you initialize your firebase application.

I am excited to keep exploring Firebase. Please connect with me on LinkedIn to follow my #30AppChallenge!
