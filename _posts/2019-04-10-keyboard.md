## What is it?

* A simple Keyboard application built with the Tone.js library
* Type 8 unique characters to set the notes for your C major scale
* Once the keyboard is initialized, have fun and start playing some music!
* Change the octave of the keyboard by pressing the up and down arrow keys

### Mapping The Keys

The main challenge I faced in building this application was figuring out an optimal way to map the notes to the keys.

My first idea was that the keys would be fixed to `a s d f g h j k`. However, I wanted the code to be generated rather than written in at author time, and I wasn't sure how to express the relationship of those keys in a simple programmatic way.

Instead, I decided to let the end user pick the keys for their keyboard, indexing each unique key that was pressed. The notes themselves are contained in an array called `orderedNotes` and the mapped keys get pushed into an array called `keyMap`. To select the corresponding note use `orderedNotes[keyMap]`.
